# AVL_geometry_generator
Generates a geometry input file for AVL, using Python


Supported geometry :
- Trapezoidal surfaces : wing and HTP
- elevator along the whole horizontal stabiliser (spanwise)
- ailerons outward limit station is at the tip of the wing
- constant elevator and ailerons hinge location ratio

- twist law is considered to be linear (to se the twist angle at the ailerons inward station)
